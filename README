Troubleshooting
==============
1. "gem install" cant find "mislav-will_paginate" or "thoughtbot-paperclip"  
  
  Install those two gems are in the gem repository as "will_paginage"
  and "paperclip"

2. Rails cannot find "mislav-will_paginate" or "thoughtbot-paperclip"

  Those two gems are installed as "will_paginage" and "paperclip" and
  you may need to edit the config.gem in the environment.rb file to 
  fit those names.
